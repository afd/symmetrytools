\begin{itemize}
\item \topspin\ was originally developed by Alastair Donaldson at the University of Glasgow, between 2003 and 2006.
\item \topspin\ uses symmetry reduction theory developed by Alastair Donaldson and Alice Miller.  This theory is
in turn based on a decade of research by the model-checking
community.
\item The approach taken by the \topspin\ implementation was influenced greatly by the SymmSpin tool, developed
by Dragan Bosnacki, Denis Dams and Lezek Holenderski.
\item The layout for this manual was inspired by the \gap\ reference manual.
\item Thanks to the developers of \gap, \saucy\ and SableCC: the development of \topspin\ would have taken a lot
longer without these excellent tools.
